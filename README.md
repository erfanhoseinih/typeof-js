#Type of variable in javascript

i want to create function to return type of variable!

already we have function for this opreation typeof() in jacascript defineded.

it's return "Undefined","object","boolean","number","bigint","string","symbol","function"

it's ok and works but when i send array it return object!

or map or set again it will return object in javascript.

now type() function can recognize the variables and return actually type
